# Text Editor
My first Java GUI based project based on **Notepad** from Windows 10.
## Features
- Saving and opening a text file with the extension **.txt**.
- Checking for saved file and open/save operations before closing the Editor.
- Hotkeys and mnemonics added for various operations including opening/saving files, zoom etc.
- Font dialog box added lets the user choose from all the fonts available on their particular machine.
## Installation
- You must have [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) installed on your system.
- Download [this](https://github.com/misraVaibhav/Text-Editor/raw/master/dist/Editor.jar) file and Double-Click on it (or Open With Jave SE) to lauch the app.
- In case it is not working, or the **.jar** file is not recognised even after installing Java, do the following :
  - Download [these](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xd3peupo92c4ejt/AAAzBN9rtbcuEqiC3xT3IILQa?dl=0) files and keep them in the same folder.
  - Double-Click on **Editor.bat**.
